Certainly! Let's work through a concrete example to illustrate the principles of postconditions and preconditions in subclassing. In this example, we'll create a simple class hierarchy representing different types of bank accounts.

**Postconditions Example:**

Let's start with the `BankAccount` superclass and a `SavingsAccount` subclass. The `BankAccount` class has a method `withdraw()` that should guarantee that the balance remains non-negative after a successful withdrawal. The `SavingsAccount` subclass will maintain this strong postcondition.

```java
class BankAccount {
    protected double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient balance.");
        }
    }
}

class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount {
    public SavingsAccount(double initialBalance) {
        super(initialBalance);
    }

    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance - amount >= 0) {  // Strong postcondition maintained
            super.withdraw(amount);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient balance.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SavingsAccount` class ensures that the postcondition for the `withdraw()` method is at least as strong as that of the `BankAccount` class. It guarantees that the balance remains non-negative after a withdrawal.

**Preconditions Example:**

Let's continue with the `BankAccount` superclass and introduce a `CheckingAccount` subclass. The `BankAccount` class has a method `deposit()` that should not impose strict preconditions on the caller. The `CheckingAccount` subclass will maintain this weaker precondition.

```java
class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount {
    public CheckingAccount(double initialBalance) {
        super(initialBalance);
    }

    @Override
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {  // Weaker precondition, allowing deposits of zero
            balance += amount;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CheckingAccount` class ensures that the precondition for the `deposit()` method is weaker than or equal to that of the `BankAccount` class. It allows deposits of zero, which maintains compatibility with existing code using the superclass.

By following the principles of postconditions and preconditions, we create subclasses that build upon the functionality of their superclasses while maintaining consistent behavior and compatibility with the code that interacts with them.
