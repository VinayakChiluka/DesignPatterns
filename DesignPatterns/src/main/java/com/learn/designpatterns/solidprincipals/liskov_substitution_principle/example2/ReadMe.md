Certainly, here are a couple more examples of violations of the Liskov Substitution Principle along with potential fixes:

**Violation 1:**

Suppose we have a class hierarchy for vehicles:

```java
class Vehicle {
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Starting engine");
    }
}

class ElectricCar extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Starting electric car");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ElectricCar` class overrides the `startEngine` method to reflect the fact that electric cars don't have traditional engines.

**Violation:**

```java
public class Main {
    static void operateVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        vehicle.startEngine();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
        Vehicle electricCar = new ElectricCar();

        operateVehicle(vehicle);     // Output: Starting engine
        operateVehicle(electricCar);  // Output: Starting electric car
    }
}
```

**Fix:**

To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, we should ensure that subclasses don't introduce new behaviors that contradict the expected behavior of the superclass. In this case, the `ElectricCar` subclass should not be introducing a method that starts the engine, but rather a method that starts the electric motor. We could rename the method in the subclass:

```java
class ElectricCar extends Vehicle {
    void startElectricMotor() {
        System.out.println("Starting electric motor");
    }
}
```

**Violation 2:**

Suppose we have a class hierarchy for employees:

```java
class Employee {
    void work() {
        System.out.println("Employee is working");
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    @Override
    void work() {
        System.out.println("Manager is delegating work");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Manager` class overrides the `work` method to reflect the fact that managers delegate work rather than directly performing tasks.

**Violation:**

```java
public class Main {
    static void assignWork(Employee employee) {
        employee.work();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee employee = new Employee();
        Employee manager = new Manager();

        assignWork(employee);  // Output: Employee is working
        assignWork(manager);   // Output: Manager is delegating work
    }
}
```

**Fix:**

To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, we should ensure that subclasses don't introduce behaviors that weaken the guarantees of the superclass. In this case, the `Manager` subclass's behavior should not deviate significantly from the `Employee` superclass's behavior. A better approach might be to introduce a separate method for delegation:

```java
class Manager extends Employee {
    void delegateWork() {
        System.out.println("Manager is delegating work");
    }
}
```

By using this approach, we preserve the core behavior of the `work` method while also introducing the new behavior specific to managers without violating the principle.
