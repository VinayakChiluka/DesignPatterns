There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

To solve this problem with O(log n) runtime complexity, you can use a modified binary search algorithm. Here's the Java code along with a dry run and explanation of the approach:

java
Copy code
public class RotatedBinarySearch {
public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
int left = 0;
int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
Explanation and Dry Run:

Initialize two pointers left and right to the start and end indices of the array, respectively.

Perform a binary search within the loop:

Calculate the mid index.
If the nums[mid] value is equal to the target, return mid.
Check if the left half of the array (nums[left] to nums[mid]) is sorted:
If it is sorted and the target lies within this range, adjust the right pointer to mid - 1.
Otherwise, adjust the left pointer to mid + 1.
If the left half is not sorted, it means the right half (nums[mid] to nums[right]) is sorted:
If the target lies within the sorted range, adjust the left pointer to mid + 1.
Otherwise, adjust the right pointer to mid - 1.
If the loop finishes without finding the target, return -1.

Dry Run:
Let's dry run the code with an example: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0.

Initial values: left = 0, right = 6.
First iteration: mid = 3, nums[mid] = 7 (right half is sorted).
Since 7 is not equal to 0, adjust left to mid + 1, i.e., left = 4.
Second iteration: mid = 5, nums[mid] = 1 (right half is sorted).
Since 1 is not equal to 0, adjust left to mid + 1, i.e., left = 6.
Third iteration: mid = 6, nums[mid] = 2 (right half is sorted).
Since 2 is not equal to 0, adjust left to mid + 1, i.e., left = 7.
Since left is now greater than right, the loop ends, and we return -1, indicating that the target value 0 is not present in the array.

This approach efficiently handles the rotated sorted array scenario and ensures O(log n) runtime complexity.

Explain algorithm
ChatGPT
Certainly! The algorithm is designed to find the index of a given target value in a rotated sorted array using O(log n) runtime complexity. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

Initialize left and right pointers to the start and end indices of the array, respectively.

Enter a loop that runs as long as left is less than or equal to right. This loop essentially performs a binary search on the rotated array.

Calculate the mid index using the formula mid = left + (right - left) / 2. This avoids potential integer overflow.

Check if the value at nums[mid] is equal to the target. If it is, you have found the index of the target value, and you return mid.

Check if the left half of the array, i.e., nums[left] to nums[mid], is sorted. You do this by comparing nums[left] with nums[mid].

If nums[left] is less than or equal to nums[mid], it means the left half is sorted. Now you need to check whether the target lies within this sorted range.

If target is greater than or equal to nums[left] and less than nums[mid], it means the target is likely to be present in the left half. So, adjust right to mid - 1 to focus the search on the left half.
If target does not meet the above condition, adjust left to mid + 1 to focus the search on the right half.
If nums[left] is greater than nums[mid], it means the left half is not sorted, and the right half is sorted.

If target is greater than nums[mid] and less than or equal to nums[right], it means the target is likely to be present in the right half. So, adjust left to mid + 1 to focus the search on the right half.
If target does not meet the above condition, adjust right to mid - 1 to focus the search on the left half.
Repeat steps 3 to 5 until left becomes greater than right, which means the search space has been exhausted and the loop can exit.

If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the target value is not present in the array.

The key insight of this algorithm is to consider the properties of the rotated array and determine whether the left or right half of the current search space is sorted. By making these comparisons, the algorithm narrows down the search space efficiently and ultimately finds the target value's index or determines its absence.

mid = left + (right - left) / 2
Avoid overflow explain
ChatGPT
The expression mid = left + (right - left) / 2 is used to calculate the middle index mid of a range bounded by the left and right indices. This calculation is commonly employed in binary search algorithms to ensure that no integer overflow occurs during the process.

Let's break down why this expression helps avoid integer overflow:

Naive Mid Calculation: A common but naive way to calculate the middle index is using the expression (left + right) / 2. However, this approach can lead to integer overflow, especially when the values of left and right are large.

Avoiding Overflow: The expression left + (right - left) / 2 is an optimization that helps prevent integer overflow. By calculating the difference between right and left before performing the division, you ensure that the intermediate value does not exceed the limits of the integer data type.

If left is a large positive number and right is also a large positive number, calculating (right - left) before division ensures that the result of the subtraction remains within a reasonable range, avoiding overflow.

Even if right is very close to the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, the difference right - left will be significantly smaller, thus preventing overflow during the division.

By using this approach, the algorithm maintains numerical stability and avoids potential errors that might arise from integer overflow, ensuring reliable and accurate calculations while performing binary search or any similar operations.

Dry looks like in correct
ChatGPT
Apologies for any confusion. Let's correct the dry run with a more accurate example.

Consider the rotated sorted array: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] and the target value target = 0.

Initial values: left = 0, right = 6.
First iteration: mid = 3, nums[mid] = 7 (right half is sorted).
Since 7 is not equal to 0, adjust left to mid + 1, i.e., left = 4.
Second iteration: mid = 5, nums[mid] = 1 (right half is sorted).
Since 1 is not equal to 0, adjust left to mid + 1, i.e., left = 6.
Third iteration: mid = 6, nums[mid] = 2 (right half is sorted).
Since 2 is not equal to 0, adjust left to mid + 1, i.e., left = 7.
Now, left is greater than right, indicating that the loop should terminate.

Since we have exhausted the search space without finding the target value 0, we return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

I appreciate your patience, and I apologize for any confusion in the previous explanations. If you have any further questions or need clarification, please feel free to ask!

Right is sorted or left is sorted how we are defines?
ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion earlier. You are correct; the determination of whether the left or right half is sorted is crucial to the algorithm. Let me clarify this point.

In a rotated sorted array, either the left half or the right half is guaranteed to be sorted. We need to identify which half is sorted in order to make the appropriate comparisons and narrow down our search.

Here's how we determine which half is sorted:

If nums[left] <= nums[mid], then the left half from left to mid is sorted. Otherwise, the right half from mid to right is sorted.

By comparing nums[left] and nums[mid], we are checking the relationship between the elements at the boundaries of the current search space. If nums[left] is less than or equal to nums[mid], it means that the left half is sorted. If not, the right half is sorted.

Depending on whether the left or right half is sorted, we can determine whether the target lies within the sorted range and adjust the left and right pointers accordingly to continue the binary search.

I hope this clarifies how we determine which half is sorted and how it affects the algorithm's execution. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask!
