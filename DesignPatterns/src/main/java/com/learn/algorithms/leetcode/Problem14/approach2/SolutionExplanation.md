Absolutely, let's walk through a dry run of the optimized Java function with the input array `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`:

1. Initialize the input array: `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`
2. Initialize the prefix with the first string: `prefix = "flower"`
3. Loop through the remaining strings:
    - For the second string `"flow"`:
        - Check if `"flow"` starts with `"flower"`. Since it doesn't, remove the last character from the prefix: `prefix = "flowe"`
        - Check if `"flow"` starts with `"flowe"`. Since it doesn't, remove the last character from the prefix: `prefix = "flow"`
        - Now `"flow"` starts with `"flow"`, so continue to the next string.
    - For the third string `"flight"`:
        - Check if `"flight"` starts with `"flow"`. Since it doesn't, remove the last character from the prefix: `prefix = "flo"`
        - Now `"flight"` starts with `"flo"`, so continue to the next string.
4. The resulting prefix after looping through all strings is `"flo"`.

The longest common prefix among the given strings `"flower"`, `"flow"`, and `"flight"` is `"flo"`.

So, the output of the optimized function would be `"flo"`. This optimized approach reduces unnecessary character comparisons and can be more efficient, especially for larger input arrays.
