Certainly, let's walk through a dry run of the Java function with the input array `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`:

1. Initialize the input array: `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`
2. Find the shortest string in the array: `"flow"` (since it has the smallest length)
3. Loop through each character of the shortest string `"flow"`:
    - Iteration 1 (i = 0): Compare `'f'` with the corresponding characters in other strings. All characters match, so continue to the next iteration.
    - Iteration 2 (i = 1): Compare `'l'` with the corresponding characters in other strings. All characters match, so continue to the next iteration.
    - Iteration 3 (i = 2): Compare `'o'` with `'i'` from `"flight"`. Characters don't match, so return `"flo"`.to the next 

The longest common prefix among the given strings `"flower"`, `"flow"`, and `"flight"` is `"fl"`.

So, the output of the function would be `"fl"`.
